# Reflection
This lab went relatively smoothly -- far smoother than the last lab. A lot of the CSS could be recycled through all of the questions. The hardest part was making the non-selected choices opaque when you choose an answer. I'd like to thank the TA's and stack overflow for pointing me in the right direction. Go see what your dream house is!
